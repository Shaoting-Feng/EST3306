# Frequency-Modulation-and-Demodulation
I have packaged the modulation and demodulation programs into a sub-VI. In the main program, based on the current tab status and input parameters, the modulation signal is generated. After being processed by the sub-VI, we obtain the desired output waveform and parameters. There is a two-second delay, and the program runs in an infinite loop.
