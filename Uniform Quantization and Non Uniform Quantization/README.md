# Uniform-Quantization-and-Non-Uniform-Quantization

Users can select a single sampling value, continuous analog signal, and custom non-uniform quantization (Task 3_5) on the front panel tabs, and run the program after inputting parameters.

Single Sampling Value: Users can choose uniform quantization and thirteen-segment piecewise linear non-uniform quantization. After inputting parameters and running the program, users can view the digital encoding, reconstructed analog signal, quantization error, and instantaneous signal-to-quantization-noise ratio.

Continuous Analog Signal: The input is a sine signal. Users can choose uniform quantization and thirteen-segment piecewise linear non-uniform quantization. After inputting parameters and running the program, users can view the signal-to-quantization-noise ratio, theoretical signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (only for uniform quantization), reconstructed analog signal waveform, and quantization noise waveform.

Custom Non-Uniform Quantization: The input signal follows the probability density function given in Task 3_5. Users can choose uniform quantization, thirteen-segment piecewise linear non-uniform quantization, and custom quantization. After inputting parameters and running the program, users can view the signal-to-quantization-noise ratio and quantization noise waveform.
